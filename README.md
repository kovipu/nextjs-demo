# nextjs-demo

Next.js is a full-stack framework of the future.
This is a quick demo of Next.js for a tech talk.

For this demo you will need
* A computer
* Node JS 16<

## Initialize a Next.js project

Run this in your code folder. It creates a new folder inside.

```
npx create-next-app nextjs-demo && cd nextjs-demo
```

After this finishes, a simple `npm run dev` will start a dev server.

A few cool things about Next:
* Next has a built in support for CSS modules.
* Next makes no assumptions on your testing library.
* The routing is generated based on file-system: `pages/about.js` maps to `/about`.
